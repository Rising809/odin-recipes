    <h1>Mofongo</h1>

    <p> <img src="../images/mofongo.jpg" alt="a mofongo"></p>

    <p>Mofongo, a dish of garlicky mashed plantains, is one of the most popular dishes in Puerto Rico. 
    It has clear roots in the fufu of West Africa. The classic way to serve mofongo is in the mortar (pil√≥n) 
    in which it was mashed.</p>
    <p>In the last several decades, mofongo has been adopted by Dominicans and is now commonly found
     in Dominican restaurants and cookbooks.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>4 Green plantains, peeled and cut into rounds on the diagona</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
        <li>3 to 5 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup Pork cracklings (chicharrones)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Soak the plantain pieces in a bowl of salted water for 15 to 30 minutes. 
        Drain well and pat dry.</li>

        <li>Heat the oil in a saute pan or skillet over medium flame. 
        Working in batches, saute the plantain slices until they are cooked through 
        but not yet browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the plantains, garlic and a little bit of olive oil to a large mortar or 
        bowl and mash with a pestle or potato masher until fairly smooth. 
        Alternatively, pulse with a food processor. Stir in the pork cracklings and salt to taste.</li>
        
        <li>Using moistened hands, form into 3-inch balls or mound on a plate and serve warm.</li>
        
     </ol>
